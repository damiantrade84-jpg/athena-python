# Sentinel Pro v4 — Claude Brief

**Safety:** Paper only. Never bypass risk/freshness/kill-switch. AI cannot override gates. No real orders without 1 week clean paper + manual approval.

**Scoring:** Locked. Do not change Engine A/B/D thresholds unless user requests. No hardcode in Python — use `config.yaml`.

**Dev:** No guessing. All changes config-gated, default-safe, with tests. Never import `athena.py` in tests. SQLite: WAL mode, 15s timeout.

**AI:** Engine B AI review-only. Preserve exact vision footer tokens. Chart Vision and Lottery AI are separate — do not mix.

**Data:** Freshness gate mandatory. H4 offsets: Binance 0h, MT5 forex 2h, MT5 stocks 3h. D1 = UTC 00:00. MT5 → `fetch_mt5()`, EODHD volume-only for Engine D.

# Workflow Orchestration

## 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

## 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One tack per subagent for focused execution

## 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

## 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

## 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes – don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

## 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests – then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## 7. Task Management
1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## 8. Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
